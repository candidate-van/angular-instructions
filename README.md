# Quick Angular Test

The following is meant as a high level assessment of your Angular familiarity. It isn't meant to see if you've memorized the Angular API. If you have questions as you go through, ask them. If you can't remember something from the [docs, look it up][docs].

## Setup

Go to [StackBlitz][sb] (or [Codesandbox][csb]) and create an empty Angular project. Ideally the project should be Angular 7 or higher. The default from Codesandbox isn't, but the link takes you to another template.

## Instructions

Create a simple page which displays the cities listed below in an organized and pleasant looking manner, also incorporating the flag of the country the city is in. The exact styling and content of the page other than the city list if up to you.

## Resources

You can copy and paste this data set to get you started:

```js
[
    {city: 'Hamilton', country: 'bm'},
    {city: 'Vancouver', country: 'ca'},
    {city: 'London', country: 'gb'},
    {city: 'Sydney', country: 'au'},
    {city: 'Hong Kong', country: 'hk'},
    {city: 'Luxembourg', country: 'lu'},
    {city: 'Japan', country: 'jp'},
    {city: 'San Francisco', country: 'us'},
];
```
